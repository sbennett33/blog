## A header2 is good

Lists are nice, too:

- Apples
- Bananas
- Pears

## This is a table

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |

## This is some sample code

```elixir
def foo() do
  :bar
end
```
